 <p> Afghanistan is a landlocked country located in South-Central Asia, known for its rugged mountains, rich cultural heritage, and complex history. It has been a crossroads of civilizations for centuries, influenced by Persian, Greek, Indian, and Islamic cultures. Despite its natural beauty and strategic location, Afghanistan has faced decades of conflict, particularly in recent years due to war and political instability. The country is home to diverse ethnic groups, including Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks, and its capital is Kabul. Afghanistan continues to work toward peace, development, and rebuilding its society.</p>
 <p>Afghanistan is located in Central Asia with Iran to the west and Pakistan to the east. Tall, forbidding mountains and dry deserts cover most of the landscape of Afghanistan. The jagged mountain peaks are treacherous, and are snow covered for most of the year.
    Many Afghans live in the fertile valleys between the mountains and grow their crops and tend to their animals. Only 20 percent of the land is used as fields.
    Summers are hot and dry but the winters are very cold, especially north of the Hindu Kush, which is located in the eastern part of the country near Pakistan and Tajikistan. Many rivers flow through the mountain gorges. Snow melt and rain that flow out of the Hindu Kush pool into a low area and never reach the ocean.
    The mountain passes in Afghanistan allow travelers passage across Asia. The country was a busy section of the Silk Road, a route that merchants have traveled over land between China, India, and Europe for over 2,000 years.</p>
